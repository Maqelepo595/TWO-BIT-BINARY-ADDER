# TWO-BIT-BINARY-ADDER
Itâ€™s a digital circuit project that adds two-bit binary numbers and produces a 3-bit output. 
        This circuit comprises two half adders and XOR, AND, OR gates to perform the indicated purpose of 
        giving out sums together with the final carry-out bit. For half_adder A, the inputs are A0 and B0, 
        while for half_adder B, the inputs are A1 and B1. The outputs are sum0, sum1, and final_carry.
