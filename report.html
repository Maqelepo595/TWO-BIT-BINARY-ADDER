    <h1>Two-Bit Binary Adder Circuit</h1>

    <h2>What the Project Does?</h2>
    <p>
        Itâ€™s a digital circuit project that adds two-bit binary numbers and produces a 3-bit output. 
        This circuit comprises two half adders and XOR, AND, OR gates to perform the indicated purpose of 
        giving out sums together with the final carry-out bit. For half_adder A, the inputs are A0 and B0, 
        while for half_adder B, the inputs are A1 and B1. The outputs are sum0, sum1, and final_carry.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Components that Build up the Project</h2>
    <p>
        The project is built up of two half adders: half_adder A and half_adder B, XOR, AND, and OR gates.
        Half_adder A takes the least significant bits of the numbers being added, while half_adder B takes 
        the most significant bits.
    </p>
    <p>
        The OR gate combines the results from the AND gate in half_adder A and the results from the AND gate 
        in half_adder B to produce the final carry-out bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The XOR gate, which is broken into AND gates and inverters, takes the least significant bits to produce sum0.
        The XOR under half_adder A takes in the sum and the output from andgate1 to produce sum1.
    </p>

    <h2>Guide Lines on How to Get Started with the Project</h2>
    <p>
        For the user to use the project, they are required to input the two binary numbers they wish to add, starting with 
        the least significant bit for both numbers. The least significant bit for the first number will be assigned to A0, 
        and for the second number, it will be assigned to B0. Then, input the second bits on A1 and B1, respectively.
    </p>
    <h3>Testing of the circuit</h3>
    <p>
    We will be testing using five combinations of binary numbers which will be adding 2and2 ,3and3,0and0,1and1,2and3.
    The first number will take place values  A0 and A1, A0 being the first least significant bit and A1 will follow being
    the most significant bit and the number being added with the first one will follow the procedure as B0 being the least significant
    and B1 being the most significant bit.

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        We met challenges whereby we had to use three half adders to achieve the task, whereby only two half adders could not work. 
        Meanwhile, we discovered a way to deal with that difficulty in order to achieve our goal with inverters.
